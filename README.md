# Conjugate Gradient Optimization (Sparse Linear Solver)

In this repository, you will find a serial, shared-memory parallel, distributed-memory parallel and hybrid implementations of the conjugate gradient optimization simulation. This is a sparse linear solver optimized using the `second-order poisson` equation.

For more details, check the individual `Readme.md` files in each sub-directory.
